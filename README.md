# Compositional transformations can reasonably introduce phenotype-associated signals in zero-inflated features

This repository contains the code suppoting our work from the manuscript "Compositional transformations can reasonably introduce phenotype-associated signals in zero-inflated features". The two notebooks contain the works relevant to the synthetic dataset, to the vaginal microbiome's association with preterm birth, and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).

To run the vaginal microbiome analysis, one first needs to download the vaginal microbiome tables from https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1502875112 under the 'Supporting information' section, specifically the two .csv and .txt files, and place them in the same directory as the Vaginal-microbiome.ipynb notebook.

The tables required to run the TCGA notebooks can be found under the original Poore et al. publication at ftp://ftp.microbio.me/pub/cancer_microbiome_analysis/. 

The analyses from all notebooks can complete on a typical laptop in less than 30 seconds.
