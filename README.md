# Compositional transformations can reasonably introduce phenotype-associated signals in zero-inflated features

This repository contains the code suppoting our work from the manuscript "Compositional transformations can reasonably introduce phenotype-associated signals in zero-inflated features". The two notebooks contain the works relevant to the synthetic dataset, and to teh vaginal microbiome's association with preterm birth.

To run the vaginal microboime dataset, one first needs to download the vaginal microboime tables from https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1502875112 under the 'Supporting information' section, specifically the two .csv and .txt files, and place them in the same directory as the Vaginal-microbiome.ipynb notebook.

The analyses from both notebooks can complete on a typical laptop in less than 10 seconds.
